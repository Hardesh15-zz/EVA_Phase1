### Rewrite it again using these convolutions in the order given below:<br>
  - Normal Convolution<br>
  - Separable Convolution <br>
  - Depthwise Convolution<br>
  - Grouped Convolution (use 3x3, 5x5 only)<br>
  - Grouped Convolution (use 3x3 only, one with dilation = 1, and another with dilation = 2)<br> 
  - You must use all of the 5 above at least once<br>
  - Train this new model for 50 epochs.<br>
