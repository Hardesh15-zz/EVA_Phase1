## Assignment_5: <br>
Change the code 8 or your own 4th Code from Assignment 4 to include:<br>
1.image normalization <br>
2.L2 regularization <br>
3.ReLU after BN <br>
Run your new code for 40 epochs and save the model with highest validation accuracy <br>
Find out 25 misclassified images from the validation dataset and create an image gallery
### Observations:
### Case-1: Using ReLU after BN=> Validation Accuracy: max-99.53%<br>
### Case-2: Using L2 regularization=> Validation Accuracy: max-99.46%<br>
### Case-3: Using activation fuction 'ReLU' after BN and L2 regularization and using Image normalization=>Validation accuracy(99.56%)
