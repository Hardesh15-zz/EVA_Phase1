Calculation of RF field -
============================
1.We can use receptive field calculation formula.
2.As mentioned in paper, K = 3, S = 2, J = 8 
since Rf = rf(in) + (k-1)J
      Rf = 29 + (3-1)8   # rf(in) is previous layer receptive field and in this case it is 29
      Rf = 29 + 16
      Rf = 45
